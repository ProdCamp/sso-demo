# ProdCamp SSO demo

This demo illustrates how to provide a seamless user experience when transitioning from your app to your public roadmap hosted by ProdCamp.

## Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine

# Setup Instructions


## Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/your-repo/prodcamp-sso-demo.git`
`cd prodcamp-sso-demo`

## Install Dependencies

`npm install cors jsonwebtoken crypto`


## Run the Backend Server

`node app.js`

This will start an API server on port 3000 that returns a token generated for a randomly generated email. For demonstration purposes, the email is generated randomly. In a real-world scenario, you would use the email of your currently logged-in user.

## Open the Frontend

Navigate to the public folder.
Open index.html in your browser.


## How It Works
Backend (app.js): The backend server generates a JWT token for a randomly generated email and serves it through an API endpoint.

Frontend (index.html): The frontend fetches the token from the backend API and redirects the user to the public roadmap using the fetched token.


## Customizing for Your Workspace
To use your own roadmap, retrieve your Workspace ID and Workspace Secret from the ProdCamp settings (only the workspace owner can see the Secret key).

**Replace the following to test on your environment:**
1. Workspace ID (app.js:10)
2. Secret Key (app.js:9)
3. Public portal URL (public/index.html:40)
